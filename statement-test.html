        <p>The primary purpose of my art is to communicate ideas in new and meaningful ways, and for this reason my work is conceptual from the start. It is also why I work with new media as it affords my ideas the widest range of tools and maximizes their means of expression. My art making process unfolds with an exploratory spirit as a dialogue between concepts and materials. I am interested in how my ideas develop and present themselves through this process more than I am in capturing an already formalized result. Rather than being an authority over my work, I think of myself as another component in its creation.
        </p>
        
        <p>In this body of work I use a variety of materials to explore the concept of addiction. Drawing on both my personal history and my academic study of philosophy, my goal with this collection is two-fold.  First, I want to create a space where I can explore the addict’s situatedness. Most people already hold some idea of what addiction is like; my motivation with this work is to show <i>why</i> it looks and feels the way it does. By dissecting my own lived experience, I seek out those mechanisms that characterize addiction. And in uncovering them, my goal is to visually present them in a way that communicates those normally unarticulated, universally shared phenomena that propel the cycle addiction - I want to visually construct for the viewer that particular metaphysical machine that churns within the addict. My hope for this work is to capture the strange ontological position these mechanisms utlimately wedge the addict into, a position from which the addict operates according to a will they know to be authentically their own, while simultaneously recognizing their circular and confounding patterns of living - a life of action they recognize as being in servitude of some ‘other.’</p>
        
        <p>Second, I want to show how it is from this paradoxical position that transformation, not only away from addiction, but into a previously unrealized and fuller kind of living is made possible. It is precisely from this paradox and through this bondage of addiction that the possibility of an <i>otherwise</i> impossible sort of liberation emerges. Having labored long enough, having cultivated enough pain, a pressurized shockwave rips through the addict, fracturing their dual identity. They recognize a new sense of autonomy in this moment, they become aware of those immediate and burdens of the present that keep them chained to their past, and they discover before them a horizon of opportunity. But breaking away from their current position is not simply an epistemic move. Despite having knowledge of their situation, the addict is still in bondage - they know to stop long before they can. Rather, this awareness is the site from which transformation occurs as a process, emerging <i>through</i> life, and therefore a task to be understood phenomenologically. It is a heuristic task that is particular to the individual, and its particularites are uncovered over time. With this characterization, I hope to present the addict in a way that highlights the importance of harm reduction; the proper treatment of the addict is not one that regards them like an object onto which a solution can be projected, but instead one that understands them as person living through a series of transitions. I want to stress that it is only through such a process that real change occurs, and therefore what’s most valuable to the addict are those conditions that allow such transformations to occur. This approach prioritizes first that domain where change is fundamentally grounded. For this reason, I my hope for the viewer is for them to leave with an understanding of harm reduction as the protection of life and its possibilities.</p>
