        The primary purpose of my art is to communicate ideas in new and meaningful ways, and for this reason my work is conceptual from the start. It is also why I work with new media as it affords my ideas the widest range of tools and maximizes their means of expression. My art making process unfolds with an exploratory spirit as a dialogue between concepts and materials. I am interested in how my ideas develop and present themselves through this process more than I am in capturing a particular, already formalized result. Rather than being an authority over my work, I think of myself as another component in its creation.

        In this body of work I use a variety of materials to explore the concept of addiction. Drawing on both my personal history and my academic study of philosophy, my goal with this collection is two-fold.  First, I want to create a space where I can explore the addict’s situatedness. Most people already hold some idea of <i>what</i> addiction is like; my motivation for this body of work is to present <i>why</i> it looks and feels the way it does. Dissecting my own lived experience, I sought to uncover those normally unarticulated components of addiction. And by doing so, my goal is to visually represent their particularities and communicate those universal, metaphysical mechanisms that churn below and direct the lived experience of addiction. My hope for this work is to capture that strange ontological position unique to the addict, a position from which the addict acts according to a will the addict would describe as authentically their own, while simultaneously doing so in a manner made manifest as direct and circular servitude of some ‘other.’

        Second, I want to show how it is from this paradoxical position that transformation, not only away from addiction, but into a previously unrealized and fuller kind of living is made possible. It is precisely from this paradox and through this bondage of addiction that the possibility of an <i>otherwise impossible</i> sort of liberation emerges. Having labored long enough, having cultivated enough pain, a pressurized shockwave rips through the addict, fracturing their dual identity. They recognize a new sense of autonomy in this moment, become aware of the present's immediate and recurrent burdens chaining them to their past, and turn towards a horizon of opportunity. But breaking away is not simply an epistemic move. Despite having knowledge of their situation, the addict is still in bondage. Rather, this awareness is the site from which transformation occurs as a <i>process</i>, emerging <i>through</i> life, and therefore a task to be understood phenomenologically. It is a heuristic task that is particular to the individual, and its particularites are uncovered over time. With this characterization, I hope to present the addict in a way that highlights the importance of harm reduction; the proper treatment of the addict is not one that regards them like an object onto which a solution can be projected, but instead one that understands them as person living through a series of transitions. I want to stress that it is only through such a process that real change occurs, and therefore what’s most valuable to the addict are those conditions that allow such transformations to present themselves as possibilities, beginning first with the safeguard of their life.
