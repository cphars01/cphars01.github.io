<p>	The primary purpose of my art is to communicate ideas in new and meaningful ways, and for this reason my work is conceptual from the start. It is also why I work with new media, as it affords my ideas the widest range of tools and maximizes their means of expression. My art making process unfolds with an exploratory spirit as a dialogue between concepts and materials. I am interested in how my ideas develop and present themselves through this process more than I am in capturing a particular, already formalized result. Rather than being an authority over my work, I think of myself as another component in its creation.

In this body of work, I used a variety of materials to explore the concept of addiction. Drawing on both my personal history and my academic study of philosophy, my goal with this collection was two-fold.  First, I wanted to create a space where I could explore the addict’s situatedness. Most people already hold some idea of what addiction is like; my motivation for this body of work was to present why it looks and feels the way it does. Dissecting my own lived experience, I sought to uncover those normally unarticulated components of addiction. And by doing so, my goal was to visually represent their particularities and communicate those universal, metaphysical mechanisms that churn below and direct the lived experience of addiction. My hope for this work was to capture that strange ontological position unique to the addict, a position wedged within a will that simultaneously feels authentically their own while also acting in servitude of some ‘other.’

<p>
Second, I wanted to show how it is from this paradoxical position that transformation, not only away from addiction, but into a previously unrealized and fuller kind of living is made possible. It is precisely from this paradox, through this bondage of addiction, that an otherwise impossible sort of liberation emerges. Having labored long enough, having cultivated enough pain, a shockwave strikes through the addict, fracturing their dual identity. In reconceptualizing their own autonomy, they break away from those immediate and recurrent burdens of their  past and turn towards a future of underdetermined possibility. This is, however, not simply an epistemic move – the addict knows to stop long before they can. Rather, this transformation is a process, it emerges through life, and it is therefore a task to be understood phenomenologically. With this characterization, I also hope to present the addict in a way that highlights the importance of harm reduction; the addict is not structured like an object to be solved, rather they are a person living through a process of metamorphosis – whatever their stage, they are a person becoming what they are. Finally, I want to stress that it is only through such a process that real change occurs for the addict, and therefore what’s most valuable to them are those conditions that protect them long enough for this transformation to take place.
