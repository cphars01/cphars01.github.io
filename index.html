<p>	The primary purpose of my art is to communicate ideas in new and meaningful ways, and for this reason my work is conceptual from the start. It is also why I work with new media, as it affords my ideas the widest range of tools and maximizes their means of expression. My art making process unfold with an exploratory spirit as a dialogue between concepts and materials. I am interested in how my ideas develop and present themselves through this process more than I am in capturing a particular, already formalized result. Rather than being an authority over my work, I think of myself as another component of it, guiding its creation.
</p>
<p>
In this body of work, I used a variety of materials to explore the concept of addiction. Drawing on both my personal history and my academic study of philosophy, my goal with this collection was two-fold.  First, I wanted to create a space where I could explore the addict’s situatedness. Most people already hold some idea of what addiction is like; my motivation for this body of work was to present why it looks and feels the way it does. By dissecting my own lived experience, I wanted to visually represent its particularities as a means of communicating those normally unarticulated components of addiction, those metaphysical mechanisms that churn below and direct the lived experience of addiction. And by doing so, my hope for this work was to capture that strange ontological position unique to the addict, a position wedged within a will that feels authentically their own and a will that simultaneously – and paradoxically – acts in servitude of some ‘other.’
</p>
<p>
Second, I wanted to show how it is precisely from this position that transformation, not only away from addiction, but into a previously unrealized and fuller kind of living is made possible. It is again paradoxically through the bondage of addiction that an otherwise impossible sort of liberation emerges. Having labored long enough, having cultivated enough pain, a shockwave strikes through the addict, fracturing their dual identity. Reconceptualizing their own autonomy, they turn away from the recurrent burdens of the past and look towards a future of underdetermined potential. However, this is not simply an epistemic move – the addict knows to stop long before they can. Rather, this transformation is a process, it emerges through life, and it is therefore a task to be understood phenomenologically. With this characterization, I also hope to present the addict in a way that highlights the importance of harm reduction; the addict is not an object to be solved but rather a living being in the process of metamorphosis – a person becoming what they are. It is only through this process that real change occurs, and therefore what’s most valuable to the addict are those conditions that protect them long enough for this process to take place.
